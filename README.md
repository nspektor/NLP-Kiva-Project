Analysis of Funding Microlending Campaigns

## Abstract
In the last few years we have seen remarkable growth in crowdfunding websites and with this growth, many researchers are gaining interest in what makes a campaign successful on websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo. There has also been growth in another variety of crowdfunding, charitable microlending on websites such as Kiva. Kiva is a website where small businesses or community groups working with charitable foundations request loans and if they are approved, the borrowers pay the lenders back. The incentives for lenders on charitable microlending sites are very different from those on Kickstarter, therefore I have analyzed loan solicitation texts on Kiva in an effort to understand what these incentives are and create a program that can predict whether a campaign was funded based on its linguistic features.
